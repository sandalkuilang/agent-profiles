# Agent Profiles

> **Unofficial.** This is a third-party tool with no affiliation to, endorsement by, or support from Anthropic or OpenAI. "Claude" and "Claude Desktop" are trademarks of Anthropic; "ChatGPT" and "Codex" are trademarks of OpenAI. This project only launches the applications you already installed, pointed at a different profile directory.

Agent Profiles is a menu bar and system tray app for running several accounts of a coding-agent desktop app in parallel, one profile each. Every profile gets its own permanently separate directory, so using one account never requires signing out of another — and profiles of different apps can run at the same time.

## Supported apps

| App | Profile is selected by | Shared file | Platforms | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude** (Claude Desktop) | `--user-data-dir` | `claude_desktop_config.json` | macOS, Windows, Linux | |
| **ChatGPT** (bundle id `com.openai.codex`) | `--user-data-dir` **and** `CODEX_HOME` | `config.toml` | macOS, Windows, Linux | the `codex` CLI reads the same `CODEX_HOME` |
| **Cursor** | `--user-data-dir` | — | macOS | |
| **Devin** | `--user-data-dir` | — | macOS | ships as Devin, identifies as `com.exafunction.windsurf` |
| **T3 Code** | `--user-data-dir` | — | macOS | |
| **VS Code** | `--user-data-dir` | — | macOS | |

Every one of these was confirmed against a real installation by the probe described below, never declared from inspection alone.

**Platforms** lists where an app has actually been checked. Where it has not, the app is simply absent — no tray section, no directory, no error row — because a user has no way of knowing this build was never tried on their system, and a row that can only fail is worse than no row. The same is true of an app that is not installed: someone with one app sees exactly the flat menu they would have seen if the others never existed.

`Shared file` is empty where no file has an obvious claim to being shared between an app's profiles. For the VS Code family `User/settings.json` is a plausible candidate, but that is a product decision rather than something a probe can establish, so nothing is shared until someone decides.

### How a profile is pinned to a process

Every supported app has to answer two separate questions, and they are not the same question:

- **Writing** — how is a launching process told which profile to use? An argument, an environment variable, or several at once.
- **Reading back** — how do we tell, later, which profile a running process belongs to?

Writing is cheap on any channel. Reading is not: recovering an argument means parsing the process table, which is routine, whereas recovering an environment variable means `KERN_PROCARGS2` on macOS, `/proc/pid/environ` on Linux and `NtQueryInformationProcess` on Windows.

So an app may write through as many channels as it needs, provided at least one of them is readable. ChatGPT is exactly that case: it needs `--user-data-dir` to move Chromium's data **and its single-instance lock**, and `CODEX_HOME` to move the credentials and configuration that are actually worth separating. Both point at the same directory, so a profile stays one folder.

### Why profile paths are short

A profile directory is `<data root>/<app id>/p/<8 characters>` rather than something more readable, and the app ids are terse for the same reason.

Several of these applications create a Unix domain socket **inside** the profile directory — VS Code writes `<version>-main.sock`, the ChatGPT desktop app writes `ipc/ipc.sock`. macOS caps a socket path at 104 bytes and Linux at 108, and that budget is shared by every naming decision above it: the product name, the app id, the profile id, and the length of the user's home directory, which is not ours to choose.

The numbers are measured, not assumed. At a 94-byte socket path VS Code started with nine processes and created its socket; at 109 bytes exactly one process survived and no socket appeared. The ChatGPT desktop app is less brittle and merely loses its socket in silence, which is harder to diagnose. An earlier layout of `profiles/<uuid>` put a perfectly ordinary installation 17 bytes over the limit before the application had written a single byte.

Because the home directory can still be long enough to exhaust the budget, creating a profile that would leave no room for a socket is refused outright, with the numbers in the message. It is the same fail-closed choice made when a process scan fails: a profile that half-works is far harder to diagnose than one that was never created.

### The Default profile

The **Default** profile is the installation that already exists on the machine — `~/Library/Application Support/Claude` for Claude, `~/.codex` for ChatGPT. Agent Profiles uses it in place: it never moves or copies the directory, and launches it with **no designation at all**, neither argument nor environment variable. Anything else would make it a different profile and orphan everything already there. Additional profiles live below the Agent Profiles data root and get their own directories.

## Important safety behavior

Claude Desktop provides no single-instance lock for a user-data directory, and starting two processes against the same directory can corrupt its databases. ChatGPT does hold one, but a duplicate exits silently, which to a user looks like a launch that did nothing.

Agent Profiles therefore rescans processes immediately before every launch. A profile that is already running gets a Focus action instead of a second launch, and an unreadable process scan **fails closed** — refusing costs one retry, guessing costs a profile.

Profile labels are manual. Account email addresses are never read from disk or displayed. Each app's account identifier — `lastKnownAccountUuid` for Claude, `tokens.account_id` for ChatGPT — is used only to warn that two profiles appear to be signed in to the same account, and only ever compared **within one app**: those two values share no namespace, so comparing across apps could produce nothing but a false warning.

## Shared configuration

Each app's shared configuration file is shared across that app's profiles. Agent Profiles keeps one source-of-truth copy per app and links each profile's file to it before launch:

- **macOS and Linux:** symbolic links.
- **Windows:** hardlinks, so Developer Mode or elevation is not required. Both paths must be on the same drive.

If a profile has an existing regular file, its contents are adopted into the shared copy when there is no shared file yet. When a shared file already exists, the profile's own copy is moved aside to `<filename>.replaced` rather than silently overwriting the configuration every other profile is using.

## Adding another app

An app is a data declaration in `src-tauri/src/app_spec.rs` — one `AppSpec` constant and one line in the registry. No OS backend is touched, which is what keeps the third app cheaper than the second.

Before declaring one, answer four questions. All four must be yes:

1. Can a profile be expressed as **one directory**?
2. Can that directory be **selected at launch**, through an argument or the environment?
3. Can the selection be **read back** off a running process?
4. Does **no global lock** survive the directories being separated?

These are limits, not obstacles to work around. A sandboxed app fails (2) because the system pins its container. An app keeping its credentials in the system keychain fails (1) because its profile is not a directory at all. Better to find that out at the declaration than three days into an implementation.

The four questions have an executable form. After declaring an app, run the manual harness against a real installation:

```bash
cd src-tauri
PROBE_APP=/Applications/Something.app cargo test -- --ignored probe --nocapture
```

The probe launches the application twice, works out which channels move its
profile and which are ignored, checks whether a second profile can live
alongside the first, and prints a draft declaration with the parts it cannot
know marked `TODO`. It runs at a path as long as the real profile layout, and
reports the socket budget every time — an id that is too long fails here rather
than in a user's tray. Try a shorter one with `PROBE_ID=<id>`.

Once declared, the same harness exercises it end to end:

```bash
cargo test -- --ignored --nocapture                          # every check
VERIFY_APP=<app id> cargo test -- --ignored launch_detect    # just the new app
```

It creates a profile, launches the real application, confirms a process scan attributes it back to that profile, confirms the app wrote its state into the profile directory rather than the stock one, quits it, and cleans up. These checks launch real applications, so they are `#[ignore]`d and never run in CI or in a normal `cargo test`.

Declare an app only for the platforms someone has actually checked. Leaving a platform's row out is honest; filling it with a plausible-looking path is a guess that ships.

## Launch at login

The management window's General tab offers an opt-in **Launch at login** toggle. It is off until you turn it on, and it starts only the tray: no profile is opened for you.

The operating system owns this setting — a login item on macOS, a registry entry on Windows, an autostart desktop entry on Linux. Agent Profiles keeps no copy of it and reads the real value each time the window opens, so turning it off in your system settings is reflected here rather than contradicted.

The toggle is hidden in development builds. A login item registered from `pnpm tauri dev` would point at a `target/debug` binary that moves, gets rebuilt, and disappears on `cargo clean`, leaving an entry that fails silently at every boot.

## General tab

The management window's **General** tab holds settings that belong to the app
as a whole rather than to any one profile: interface language, Launch at
login (moved here from its own section), and automatic updates. It writes one
`settings.json` at the root of Agent Profiles' data directory, sibling to each
app's own `<app>/` folder — nothing here is mirrored into any profile.

### Language

Agent Profiles' interface is available in **English, Bahasa Indonesia, 日本語
(Japanese), Deutsch (German), Español (Spanish)** and **Português
(Portuguese)**. Switching languages on the General tab takes effect
immediately, no restart needed, and the choice is remembered in
`settings.json`.

Translated is the interface chrome: headings, buttons, labels, and the
messages this frontend generates itself (like "Enter a label for this
profile."). **Not** translated: profile labels and paths, which are your own
data, and messages the Rust backend returns — like refusing a duplicate label
or a profile whose Claude Desktop is still running. Those come from the same
process that enforces the actual rule and are always in English today.

### Automatic updates

A switch, off until you turn it on — the same convention as Launch at login.
When it is on, Agent Profiles checks this repository's GitHub releases in the
background (roughly every six hours, and once again the first time a person
clicks **Check for updates now**), and if a newer one has been published, it
downloads and installs it **without asking**: no "an update is available"
dialog, no progress window, no "restart now?" prompt. It restarts itself
straight onto the new version once installed.

This checks published releases, not drafts. A tag pushed to `v*` builds and
attaches artifacts to a **draft** release (see below); it becomes visible to
the updater, and to anyone browsing the Releases page, only once a maintainer
publishes it.

The switch is hidden entirely in development builds — `pnpm start` never has
an installed binary for the updater to replace, the same reason Launch at
login is hidden there too.

Update artifacts are signed with a keypair made for the updater alone (`tauri
signer generate`), which is unrelated to the OS code-signing certificates
this project cannot afford. It only proves an update came from this
repository's own release process, not from whoever happens to control the
download — the public half lives in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
(`plugins.updater.pubkey`), and the private half is a `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
/ `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` pair of GitHub Actions secrets that
`release.yml` passes to the build. Without both secrets set, tagging a
release still builds and publishes normally; it just cannot produce artifacts
the updater will trust, and the switch on the General tab has nothing to find.

## Platform status

CI compiles and tests all three platforms on their own runners, but the Windows and Linux tests only exercise parsing and path logic against fixtures — no one has ever launched this app on either. **Compiling is not running, and a passing unit test is not acceptance.** An unchecked box means the behavior has never been observed on real hardware, not that it is known to be broken.

You do not need a Windows or Linux machine to check that this still builds and its tests still pass there. [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) has a recipe for each.

The Rust suite passes on macOS: **142 tests, 0 failures**, plus 4 `#[ignore]`d checks that drive real applications.

### macOS — verified against real applications

Confirmed by the harness driving real installations of the supported applications:

- [x] All six apps detected as installed, each stock profile resolved at its own kind of path
- [x] Account identity read from both shapes of file — a top-level field for Claude, a nested one for ChatGPT
- [x] A profile launches, and a process scan attributes that pid back to it — for the argument-only app and for the argument-plus-environment one
- [x] The designation takes effect: the launched app writes its state into the profile directory, not the stock one
- [x] Quit terminates the instance and it disappears from the process table
- [x] **Two apps run side by side, and neither app's process is ever attributed to the other** — the premise the whole design rests on
- [x] A profile path leaves room for the socket an application creates inside it, verified by launching one at the real profile path
- [x] A profile deleted after quitting leaves nothing behind

### macOS — the management window and the tray

Confirmed by a person driving the app with all six applications installed:

- [x] Tray menu opens and lists each app's profiles under its own heading
- [x] Management window opens from the tray; closing it hides the window and the tray survives
- [x] Adding a profile from the management window, including the app picker that appears only with more than one app installed
- [x] Deleting a profile from the management window
- [x] A duplicate label is refused, and the refusal appears beside the form that caused it
- [x] Renaming a profile from the management window
- [x] A blank label is refused
- [x] Deletion is refused while that profile is running, and the confirmation shows the directory size
- [x] The window refuses to be resized below its usable minimum
- [x] Tray liveness marker follows an app being launched and quit

One box remains, and it cannot be closed before a release exists:

- [ ] The Launch at login toggle registers and removes a login item, and survives a reboot

The toggle is deliberately hidden in development builds, because a login item registered from `pnpm start` would point at a `target/debug` binary that moves, gets rebuilt, and disappears on `cargo clean`. Closing this box needs an installed release build and a real reboot.

Automated UI driving was attempted and abandoned: macOS attributes Accessibility to the responsible process, and a headless agent session has no grantable one. These boxes still need a person.

### Windows — compiles in CI, never run

- [x] CSV process parsing, the multi-app process filter, and the MSIX/classic path-picker logic covered by unit tests (run on macOS)
- [x] **Compiles on a real Windows runner**, and passes `clippy -D warnings` and the test suite there. Compiling is not running: everything below is unobserved
- [ ] Real process shape of either installed app
- [ ] MSIX vs classic default-directory selection against a real installation
- [ ] The declared ChatGPT install path — a plausible guess, never checked against a real Windows install
- [ ] Hardlink creation for the shared configuration
- [ ] Parallel instances, focus, quit, end-to-end launch
- [ ] Launch at login writes and removes its registry entry

### Linux — compiles in CI, never run

- [x] Desktop-identity helpers, per-app window classes and filenames, `.desktop` metadata, and Wayland detection covered by unit tests (run on macOS)
- [x] **Compiles on a real Ubuntu runner**, and passes `clippy -D warnings` and the test suite there. Compiling is not running: everything below is unobserved
- [ ] Real `claude-desktop` process shape and default data path
- [ ] The declared ChatGPT command name and install path — a plausible guess, never checked against a real Linux install
- [ ] Per-profile `--class` producing a distinct taskbar identity
- [ ] X11 focus via `xdotool`, and the Wayland limitation path
- [ ] Symlink creation, parallel instances, quit flow
- [ ] Launch at login writes and removes its autostart desktop entry

Contributions running Windows or Linux are especially welcome — checking one of those boxes with a real report is worth more than any further test written on macOS.

## Linux and Wayland focus limitation

Native Wayland does not allow one application to raise another application's window. On Wayland, the tray's Focus action reports that limitation and points the user to the profile's taskbar entry or Alt-Tab. On X11, the app can use `xdotool` when it is installed. Each desktop identity is keyed by app id and the profile's immutable id, so renaming a label rewrites the same identity rather than leaving a stale entry, and the same profile id under two apps never collides.

## Task-switcher icons

On macOS and Windows, all instances of one app intentionally share that app's icon in the operating system's task switcher. Agent Profiles does not create per-profile app bundles, because doing so would add code-signing and update-maintenance risk. The tray is the navigation surface on those platforms. Linux is designed differently: each profile receives its own desktop identity and taskbar entry, but that behavior still awaits live Linux acceptance.

## Windows MSIX caveat

The official Windows installation of Claude Desktop may be an MSIX package. Windows can virtualize its writes, so the effective data directory may be:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_pzs8sxrjxfjjc\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude
```

rather than:

```text
%APPDATA%\Claude
```

Agent Profiles probes both and prefers the MSIX package path when both exist. The Windows acceptance run must confirm which path the installed build actually uses. The binary may likewise come from the direct-install location or the WindowsApps execution alias.

## Build

This repository is built with `pnpm` and a Rust toolchain. Any installation of either will do.

The toolchain here is managed with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), which installs and pins language runtimes per project. If you use mise and its shims are not already on `PATH`, add them first:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH"
```

If your Rust came from [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or your system package manager, ignore that line — `cargo` is already on your `PATH` and everything below works unchanged.

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the unsigned local development app:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Start it this way rather than running the binary from `target/debug` directly. A development build loads its interface from the Vite dev server, so a bare binary opens a management window that is blank — the app is fine, it simply has nothing to show.

Create an unsigned local bundle for the current platform:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

Run every gate CI runs, before opening a pull request:

```bash
pnpm check
```

That is the frontend build followed by `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo test`, stopping at the first failure. CI runs them as separate steps so a failure names itself in the job log; locally one command is enough. The build is expected to be warning-free. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Releases

Tagging `v*` builds on three runners and attaches the artifacts to a draft GitHub Release: one universal macOS `.dmg` covering both Intel and Apple Silicon, Windows `.msi`/`.exe`, and Linux `.AppImage`/`.deb`. The Linux runner is pinned to Ubuntu 22.04 on purpose — a binary linked against a newer glibc refuses to start on older distributions, and the error it produces blames the wrong thing.

## Installing a release build

Releases are **unsigned**, because code-signing certificates cost money this project does not have. The operating system will therefore object, and the objection is misleading in both cases:

- **macOS** claims the app "is damaged and can't be opened". It is not damaged; it is merely unsigned. Right-click the app and choose **Open**, then confirm. If macOS still refuses, clear the quarantine flag: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Agent Profiles.app"`
- **Windows** shows a SmartScreen warning about an unknown publisher. Choose **More info → Run anyway**.

Only do this for a build you obtained from this project's Releases page. If either warning appears for a download from anywhere else, it deserves your suspicion.
